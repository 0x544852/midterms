# Food AI

Using deeplearning we can take pictures of our food to determine what we are eating and get all kinds of related information about the food from recipes, calorie and possibly risks/benifits.
This project is ambitous in the long run we will develop a few seperate models which will be used in a pipe-line, where one model will determine features of the food, from there we can isolated which classes of food could be in the image. Using a model pipeline will increase the overall accuaracy of our predictions.



## Features to be added
- Get allreciepes that could be used on a certain dish
- Calorie Counting
- Feature detection and personalized Food CNN for each user

### Development Cycle: 
- Alot of time went into researching the correct approach to develop our models, that said there were a few areas we still need to improve on. 
- The models are quite large and need to be compressed, looking into dynamically adding new classes for specific users. 
-Adding new classes dynamically is a huge challenge and we spent a considerable amount of time researching this but was decided due to time constraints
 to quickly finish a working version of a smal model and update it with features we want to implement.
